            A console game is a form of video game, consisting of manipulable images (and usually sounds)
            generated by a video gameconsole and displayed on a television or similar audio-video system.
            The game itself is usually controlled and manipulated using a handheld device connected to 
            the console, called a controller. The controller generally contains a number of buttons and 
            directional controls such as analogue joysticks, each of which has been assigned a purpose
            for interacting with and controlling the images on the screen. The display, speakers, console, 
            and controls of a console can also be incorporated into one small object known as a handheld game.
